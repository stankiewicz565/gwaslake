<p>We are indebted to the MRC Integrative Epidemiology Unit for producing the infrastructure leading to the following schematic:</p>

<a href="#caveat-about-software-component-maintenance" class="anchor"></a>Caveat about software component maintenance</h2>
<p>The packages identified in the ecosystem are mostly accessed through github repositories. The interdependencies and idiosyncrasies of using Remotes in DESCRIPTION made it difficult to produce a container image, so I have forked several of the packages identified in the schematic, to tweak the DESCRIPTIONs. I have filed some pull requests but have not heard back. I will try to keep the DESCRIPTION for this workshop package current, minimizing use of forks, and hope individual package maintainers will get in touch.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://mrcieu.github.io/ieugwasr/articles/guide.html">pkgdown document</a> on <code>ieugwasr</code> is highly informative. We work through some examples here to verify functionality of our container.</p>
<p>First, by using the searchable table above, we can obtain the study id for “Asthma”: <code>ieu-a-44</code>. We can then obtain the top “hits” for this trait (a p-value threshold can be specified; default is 5e-8).</p>
